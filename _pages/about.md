**Hello!** I'm a second year PhD student in [Carrasco Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/carrascolab/) at [NYU](https://gsas.nyu.edu/). My research interests center on leveraging computational modeling and neuroimaging techniques to better understand the complexities of the human visual encoding process. I'm particularly intrigued by the differences between human and computer vision. By studying the unique properties of human visual perception, I aim to contribute to the development of computer vision systems that more accurately mimic human visual capabilities, as well as to advance VR/AR technologies. Feel free to connect if youâ€™re also enthusiastic about vision science and AI!

Academic Interests
------
1. Investigating neural and behavioral mechanisms of human visual perception through:
   * Psychophysics experiments;
   * Non-invasive neurostimulation techniques;
   * Neuroimaging methods. 
3. Exploring computational frameworks that account for human visual perception, including:
   * Generalized linear and non-linear models (e.g. Linear Amplifier Model, Perceptual Template Model, Naka-Rushton function);
   * Bayesian inference and Bayesian modeling.

Others
------
Beyond research, I'm also interested in quantitative finance. I enjoy studying mathematical models and statistical techniques applied in financial markets, particularly those related to trading strategies, risk modeling, and decision-making under uncertainty. I'm currently learning more about portfolio optimization, options pricing, and the applications of machine learning in finance.
