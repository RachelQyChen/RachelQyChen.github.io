üìçThis project investigated rapid forgetting in Epilepsy patients through Persyst spike detection analysis.


Description
======
As a Research Assistant in the [Leeman-Markowski Lab](https://leemanlab.org/epilepsy-cognition) at [Department of Neurology, NYU Grossman School of Medicine](https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/neurology/), I worked on a clinical research project examining rapid forgetting in patients with epilepsy, aiming to investigate the relationship between interictal activity and short-term memory performance. I conducted EEG data analysis using Persyst spike detection to identify and quantify epileptiform activity. This research contributes to a better understanding of cognitive decline associated with epilepsy.
