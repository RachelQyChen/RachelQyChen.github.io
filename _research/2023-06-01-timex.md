üìçThis project investigated the temporal dynamics of exogenous attention on visual sensitivity and tried to answer whether inhibition of return is also in visual perception.


Description
======
This project examined whether inhibition of return (IOR)‚Äîa delayed cost typically observed in reaction time tasks following exogenous cues‚Äîalso affects perceptual sensitivity. Participants performed an orientation discrimination task under varying cue-to-target intervals and spatial uncertainty levels. We found that while exogenous attention benefits on perception diminished over time, sensitivity at cued locations never dropped below that at uncued locations. These results indicate that IOR reflects motor, not perceptual, inhibition‚Äîdemonstrating that perception continues to benefit from exogenous attention even at longer delays.
